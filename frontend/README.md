# 1. Docker

## Option 1: only start React with the dev server

### Option 1, Step 1: start the container

From the project root directory, run:

`docker-compose run -p 8080:3000 frontend [--build]`

**IMPORTANT**: remember to include the `-p`/`--publish` flag to make sure that the host port `8080` is mapped to the container port `3000`.

### Option 1, Step 2: get inside the container

1. **List the running containers**: `docker ps`
2. _Copy_ the `NAME` or the `CONTAINER ID`
3. `docker exec -it [NAME | CONTAINER ID] sh`

## Option 2: start the full stack

**Warning**: the below command needs to be executed from the project root folder (above), which contains `docker-compose.yml`. The below commands will not work if you run them from this directory.

### Option 2, Step 1: build and run all the services together

`docker-compose build`

**NOTE**: building is optional but rebuilding is recommended after installing new dependencies.

`docker-compose up [--build]`

### Option 2, Step 2: get inside the running container

1. **List the running containers**: `docker ps`
2. _Copy_ the `NAME` or the `CONTAINER ID`
3. `docker exec -it [NAME | CONTAINER ID] sh`

# 2. React: Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
